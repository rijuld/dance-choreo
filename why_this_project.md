## Why are you applying to this project?

I am applying to the **AI-Enabled Choreography - Dance Beyond Music** project because I am deeply inspired by its interdisciplinary approach—blending artificial intelligence, human movement, and artistic interpretation. This project aligns perfectly with my dual passions: developing impactful AI systems and exploring how technology can support human creativity instead of reducing it. I find the idea of translating diverse modalities—such as text, music, architecture, and proprioception—into dance movement incredibly compelling. It opens doors to a radically inclusive and expressive way of thinking about choreography and embodiment in AI. I am excited by the challenge of building a generative model that honors the complexity and depth of human motion in multimodal form.

## Do you have any artistic background or creative hobbies?

While I come from a computer science and machine learning background, I’ve always been drawn to artistic expression. I enjoy writing, filmmaking, and exploring performance arts as a viewer and amateur creator. During my undergraduate studies, I co-created a short film that won an award at a student conference, and I regularly write creative essays and articles on technology’s cultural impact. I’ve also dabbled in learning the guitar and enjoy how rhythm and improvisation play into creativity. Though not formally trained in dance, I have a deep respect for the art form and am eager to collaborate with artists to better understand its nuances.

## Do you have any particular experience with the intersection of AI and art?

Yes! I’ve worked on several projects at the intersection of AI and creativity, including a deep learning-powered tool for emotional tone modulation in text (inspired by affective computing), and I’ve explored style transfer and generative visual art with GANs. I’ve also researched applications of NLP in storytelling contexts, including semantic scene representation. Most recently, I contributed to a system that visualized machine learning concepts for educational storytelling using interactive UI/UX components.

## What are some of the potential benefits and drawbacks, in your mind, in incorporating AI into the creative process?

AI has the potential to radically augment human creativity—acting not just as a tool, but as a collaborator that introduces novel patterns, interpretations, and connections we might not consciously imagine. In dance, AI could help reveal hidden structures in movement or enable cross-cultural improvisation by translating between modalities like spoken poetry and choreography.

However, the drawbacks are just as real. There is a risk of flattening the richness of artistic traditions into mere datasets or privileging aesthetics that conform to the biases of training data. Creativity could become overly commodified or depersonalized if we do not remain intentional about preserving the human element.

## How do you like to collaborate on research projects?

I’m a flexible collaborator who thrives in both independent and team settings. I enjoy a mix of real-time (video calls or pair programming) and asynchronous (GitHub issues, Slack, Google Docs) workflows. I particularly value clear documentation and shared creative ownership. Open dialogue and feedback loops are essential to me—I love refining ideas through conversation and critique.

## Do you have any particular ideas you’d be excited to try on the subject of multimodal representations of dance?

One idea I’m excited about is incorporating spatial memory and proprioceptive cues as a modality—perhaps by translating architectural floor plans or haptic feedback into movement patterns. I’m also intrigued by the idea of using large language models (LLMs) to generate poetic or metaphorical descriptions of dance movements and then translating those into 3D choreography, experimenting with the poetic-to-physical pipeline.

## Anything else you’d like us to know?

I'm enthusiastic, driven, and genuinely excited to collaborate with artists and researchers who are reimagining the boundaries of machine intelligence. I view this project not only as an opportunity to contribute technically but also as a chance to grow creatively and expand how I think about embodied AI systems.
